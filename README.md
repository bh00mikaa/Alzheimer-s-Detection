## Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to aid in the detection of Alzheimer's disease using medical data.

### Key Features:

- **Dataset**: Utilizes the OASIS longitudinal dataset containing demographic and clinical data of individuals with and without dementia.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing outlier detection.
- **Model Training**: Implements a pipeline incorporating Random Forest Classifier for classification tasks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs grid search to fine-tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizes the confusion matrix for deeper insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of the dataset to explore the distribution of features and target classes.

### Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
